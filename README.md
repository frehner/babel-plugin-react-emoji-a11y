# babel-plugin-react-emoji-a11y

A heavy-handed babel plugin for React that forces your emojis to be accessible by wrapping them in `<span role="img" aria-label="{label}">`. The goal is that developers will be warned where their code isn't accessible (so that they can fix it), while also forcing the code to be accessible behind the scenes.
